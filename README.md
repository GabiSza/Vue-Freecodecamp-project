# Vue-Freecodecamp-project

I am learning with the freecodecamp videos as well and I am coding along while building some simple VUE apps.

## Where do you find the tutorial for this practice project?

I am so grateful for this video because it really helped me to understand VUE better.

### What else do you need?

Go to the <vuejs.org> page and copy the script tag as it is also shown in the youtube video.
